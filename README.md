## About Me

I am a data and operations professional with a strong foundation in cybersecurity, governance, risk, and compliance (GRC), and a growing focus on identity and access management (IAM). My background spans analytics, service operations, and project leadership, allowing me to bridge technical controls with business and regulatory requirements.

I have hands-on experience supporting enterprise environments through data-driven monitoring, operational readiness, and process improvement initiatives. I am particularly interested in how IAM, security controls, and risk management intersect to protect sensitive data, support compliance, and enable secure, scalable operations.

My work and studies emphasize:
- Translating technical risk into business impact
- Supporting secure access and identity governance
- Strengthening operational resilience through proactive monitoring
- Collaborating across technical, operational, and leadership teams

This GitHub portfolio highlights my certifications, academic projects, and practical case studies that demonstrate my approach to security, IAM, and GRC within real-world environments.
